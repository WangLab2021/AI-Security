#### [1] **FIA: [Feature Importance-aware Transferable Adversarial Attacks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.14185.pdf)  (ICCV 2021)**

​	This work proposes a Feature Importance-aware Attack (FIA) to improve the transferability of untargeted adversarial examples by disrupting important object-aware features that dominate model decisions consistently. Extensive experimental evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness and superior performance of the proposed FIA, i.e., improving the success rate by 9.5% against normally trained models and 12.8% against defense models as compared to the state-of-the-art transferable attacks.
